Neutron stars are probably the most compact and extreme magnetised astrophysical objects in the universe.
The unbelievably intense magnetic fields they carry are known to be responsible for many astrophysical phenomena.
Therefore, understanding the astrophysics of these extreme compact objects are the key to solve many puzzling problems on highly energetic astrophysical phenomena.

Different physical effects are imprinted on the gravitational wave of the inspiral and post-merger phases of a binary neutron star system.
Although the gravitational wave of the inspiral phase and post-merger phase are well understood, there is still a gap between the inspiral and post-merger signals.

Until recently, the connection between inspiral and post-merger signals is gaining clarity by investigating how the gravitational wave signals at the merger can be used to probe the <sup>2</sup>f-mode of two initial neutron stars.
In this work, we provide a very natural interpretation of a universal behaviour of the gravitational-wave frequency at merger reported in previous works, but whose physical origin had not been fully understood.
