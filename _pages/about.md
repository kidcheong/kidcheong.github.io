Welcome to my homepage!
I am a postdoctoral research fellow of the [Network for Neutrinos, Nuclear Astrophysics, and Symmetries (N3AS)](https://n3as.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California, Berkeley. 
Currently, as a N3AS fellow, I stations at the University of New Hampshire with [Prof. Francois Foucart](https://sites.google.com/site/francoisfoucart) as the faculty host.

My research focuses on numerical simulations of extreme astrophysical explosions, such as neutron star mergers and core-collapse supernovae.
To capture the physics during these dynamical processes, I develop large-scale high-performance computing general-relativistic simulation codes.
Since 2019, I have developed the new open-source numerical infrastructure for generic astrophysical simulation named [Gmunu](https://kidcheong.github.io/gmunu/) (General-relativistic multigrid numerical solver). 
Within the N3AS network, I will primarily work on numerical modellings of highly magnetized neutron stars, neutron star mergers and core-collapse supernovae.
