Gmunu (General-relativistic multigrid numerical solver) is a new open-source, parallelized, block-grid adaptive, multi-dimensional general-relativistic resistive magneto-hydrodynamics (GRRMHD) code in curvilinear geometries in dynamical spacetimes.

The git repo is still working in progress, coming soon.
